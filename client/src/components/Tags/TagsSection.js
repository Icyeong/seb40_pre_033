              Python is a multi-paradigm, dynamically typed, multi-purpose
              programming language. It is designed to be quick to learn,
              understand, and use, and enforces a clean and uniform syntax.
              Please note that Python 2 is officially out of support as of
              2020-01-01. For version-specific Python questions, add the
              [python-2.7] or [python-3.x] tag. When using a Python variant
              (e.g. Jython, PyPy) or library (e.g. Pandas, NumPy), please
              include it in the tags.
